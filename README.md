# Rivuletpy

Large scale 3D Neuron Tracing/Neuron reconstruction in Python for 3D microscopic images powered by the Rivulet2 algorithm. Pain-free Install & Use in 5 mins.

Rivuletpy is a Python3 toolkit for automatically reconstructing single neuron models from 3D microscopic image stacks. It is actively maintained by the RivuletStudio @ University of Sydney, AU. The project was initiated in the [BigNeuron project](https://alleninstitute.org/bigneuron/about/)

The `rtrace` command is powered by the latest neuron tracing algorithm Rivulet2 (Preprint hosted on BioArxiv):

Siqi Liu, Donghao Zhang, Yang Song, Hanchuan Peng, Weidong Cai, "Automated 3D Neuron Tracing with Precise Branch Erasing and Confidence Controlled Back-Tracking", bioRxiv 109892; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/109892

The predecessor Rivulet1 was published on Neuroinformatics:

Siqi Liu, Donghao Zhang, Sidong Liu, Dagan Feng, Hanchuan Peng, Weidong Cai, 
"Rivulet: 3D Neuron Morphology Tracing with Iterative Back-Tracking", 
Neuroinformatics, Vol.14, Issue 4, pp387-401, 2016.

A C++ implementation of the Rivulet2 algorithm is also available in the lastest [Vaa3D](https://github.com/Vaa3D) sources under the [Rivulet Plugin](https://github.com/Vaa3D/vaa3d_tools/tree/master/released_plugins/v3d_plugins/bigneuron_siqi_rivuletv3d) (Not yet available in the released build). However you can build Vaa3D easily on Mac/Linux following the [Vaa3D wiki](https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/Build-Vaa3D-on-Linux) carefully.

## Issues / questions / pull requests

Issues should be reported to the
[Rivuletpy github repository issue tracker](https://github.com/RivuletStudio/rivuletpy/issues).
The ability and speed with which issues can be resolved depends on how complete and
succinct the report is. For this reason, it is recommended that reports be accompanied
with a minimal but self-contained code sample that reproduces the issue, the observed and
expected output, and if possible, the commit ID of the version used. If reporting a
regression, the commit ID of the change that introduced the problem is also extremely valuable
information.

Questions are also welcomed in the [Rivuletpy github repository issue tracker](https://github.com/RivuletStudio/rivuletpy/issues).
If you put on a `question` label. We consider every question as an issue since it means we should have made things clearer/easier for the users.

Pull requests are definitely welcomed! Before you make a pull requests, please kindly create an issue first to discuss the optimal solution.

## Installation
note: 3B means the option B for the third step

Before 0A, you should firstly install Anaconda or virtuaulenv on your computer
### 0A. Setup the Anaconda environment (Easy)
```
$ conda create -n riv python=3.4
$ source activate riv
```
### 0B. Setup the virtualenv (Alternative)
It is recommended that you use [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install
`Rivuletpy` into a [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). The following
assumes a `virtualenv` named `riv` has been set up and
activated. We will see three ways to install `Rivuletpy`
```
$ virtualenv -p python3 riv
$ . riv/bin/activate
```

### 1. Setup the dependencies
To install rivuletpy with pip, you need to install the following packages manually beforehand since some dependencies of rivuletpy uses them in their setup scripts
* `numpy>=1.8.0`
* `scipy>=0.17.0`
* `Cython>=0.25.1`
* `tqdm-dev`
* `libtiff-dev`

```
(riv)$ pip install --upgrade pip
(riv)$ pip install numpy scipy matplotlib cython git+https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm.git@a379e330d013cf5f7cec8e9460d1d5e03b543444#egg=tqdm git+https://github.com/pearu/pylibtiff.git@e56519a5c2d594102f3ca82c3c14f222d71e0f92#egg=libtiff
(riv)$ conda install tifffile -c conda-forge
(riv)$ conda install -c pranathi scikit-fmm #for python3.4
```
### 2A. Install Rivuletpy from the Pypi (Recommended)

```
(riv)$ pip3 install rivuletpy
```
If you are using Anaconda
```
(riv)$ pip install rivuletpy # The pip should be correspnded to python3
```

### 2B. Install Rivuletpy from source (Optional)
Optionally you can install Rivuletpy from the source files

```
(riv)$ git clone https://github.com/RivuletStudio/rivuletpy.git
(riv)$ cd rivuletpy
(riv)$ python setup.py develop # Needed since we use the fast-forward 'tqdm' and 'pylibtiff'
(riv)$ pip3 install -e .
```

This installs `Rivuletpy` into your `virtualenv` in "editable" mode. That means changes
made to the source code are seen by the installation. To install in read-only mode, omit
the `-e`.




## Test Installation
In ./rivuletpy/
`sh quicktest.sh`

This will download a simple neuron image and perform a neuron tracing with rivulet2 algorithm. If you encountered any issues while installing Rivuletpy, you are welcome to raise an issue for the developers in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RivuletStudio/rivuletpy/issues)

## Usage
- Reconstruct single neuron file.

The script rtrace command will be installed
```bash
$ rtrace --help
usage: rtrace [-h] -f FILE [-o OUT] [-t THRESHOLD] [-z ZOOM_FACTOR]
              [--save-soma] [--no-save-soma] [--soma] [--no-soma]
              [--speed SPEED] [--quality] [--no-quality] [--clean]
              [--no-clean] [--silent] [--no-silent] [-v] [--no-view]

Arguments to perform the Rivulet2 tracing algorithm.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  The input file. A image file (*.tif, *.nii, *.mat).
  -o OUT, --out OUT     The name of the output file
  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        threshold to distinguish the foreground and
                        background. Defulat 0. If threshold<0, otsu will be
                        used.
  -z ZOOM_FACTOR, --zoom_factor ZOOM_FACTOR
                        The factor to zoom the image to speed up the whole
                        thing. Default 1.
  --save-soma           Save the automatically reconstructed soma volume along
                        with the SWC.
  --no-save-soma        Don't save the automatically reconstructed soma volume
                        along with the SWC (default)
  --soma                Use the morphological operator based soma detection
  --no-soma             Don't use the morphological operator based soma
                        detection (default)
  --speed SPEED         The type of speed image to use (dt, ssm). dt would
                        work for most of the cases. ssm provides slightly
                        better curves with extra computing time
  --quality             Reconstruct the neuron with higher quality and
                        slightly more computing time
  --no-quality          Reconstruct the neuron with lower quality and slightly
                        more computing time
  --clean               Remove the unconnected segments (default). It is
                        relatively safe to do with the Rivulet2 algorithm
  --no-clean            Keep the unconnected segments
  --silent              Omit the terminal outputs
  --no-silent           Show the terminal outputs & the nice logo (default)
  -v, --view            View the reconstructed neuron when rtrace finishes
  --no-view


$ rtrace -f example.tif -t 10 # Simple like this. Reconstruct a neuron in example.tif with a background threshold of 10
$ rtrace -f example.tif -t 10 --quality # Better results with longer running time
$ rtrace -f example.tif -t 10 --quality -v # Open a 3D swc viewer after reconstruction 
```

Please note that Rivulet2 is powerful of handling the noises, a relatively low intensity threshold is preferred to include all the candidate voxels.

- Compare a swc reconstruction against the manual ground truth
```
$ compareswc --help
usage: compareswc [-h] --target TARGET --groundtruth GROUNDTRUTH
                  [--sigma SIGMA]

Arguments for comparing two swc files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --target TARGET       The input target swc file.
  --groundtruth GROUNDTRUTH
                        The input ground truth swc file.
  --sigma SIGMA         The sigma value to use for the Gaussian function in
                        NetMets.

$ compareswc --target r2_tracing.swc --groundtruth hand_tracing.swc
0.9970 0.8946 0.9865 1 3
```
The `compareswc` command outputs five numbers which are in order: 

precision, recall, f1-score, No. connection error type A, No. connection error type B

--Gao Rong Code Usage:
$python groupoperation.py

## FAQ
### What if I see ```...version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found...``` when I run `rtrace` under Anaconda?
Try
```
(riv)$ conda install libgcc # Upgrades the gcc in your conda environment to the newest
```

### What if I see ```Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx2.so or libmkl_def.so.```?
Try to get rid of the mkl in your conda, it has been reported to cause many issues
```
(riv)$ conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr
(riv)$ conda remove mkl mkl-service
```
